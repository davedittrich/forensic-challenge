SUMMARY
-------
Here you will find all of the answers, based on the activity 
we captured within the Honeynet.  The answers are based in
the format of firewal and IDS logs and the actual keystrokes
of the blackhat.

Many of you noticed that the clock on the honeypot and the 
IDS/Firewall system were off.  In fact, the honeypot was 
57 minutes, 9 seconds ahead of the IDS/Firewall system.  
This replicates the fact that often in forensic analysis 
you will have to use sources that have different time values.  


The answers are broken down into four parts.

1-probe.txt:
This file contains the information on how the system
was probed on 7 Nov, 23:11

2-attack.txt:
This file contains the informaiton on how the system
was compromised 7 Nov, 23:11

3-owned.txt
This file contains the keystrokes of how the blackhat
got in, and what he did once he was in 8 Nov. 

4-after.txt
Our blackhat returned twice after we pulled the images 
from the honeypot.  He returned on 10 Nov and again on
22 Nov.  This file contains the keystrokes.
