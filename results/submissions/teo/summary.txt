INCIDENT SUMMARY


An intrusion into one of our servers was discovered on the morning of Nov 9.
The server was immediately shutdown to prevent further damages and to 
preserve evidence. 

A full forensics analysis has been performed on the server. We now have full
knowledge of when and how the intrusion took place. The hacker utilized a 
remote buffer-overflow technique to gain entry into the server. We have also
indentified the remote machine from which the attack was launched. After 
gaining root access into the server, the attacker installed a network sniffer 
and a backdoor in the form of a trojanised ssh1 daemon. He also installed 
trojanised system programs to hide these processes.

The damages are minimal and within control. The vulnerability concerned has
been patched up, and the server shall be restored to its previous state fully.
Normal services shall resume shortly.
