[=-=-=-=-=-=-=]             Miscelaneous information         [=-=-=-=-=-=-=]

Other information gained during the analysis include:
1) strings output from swap.  We can find some interesting information:

8x	REMOTEHOST=c871553-b.jffsn1.mo.home.com
4x	USER=adm1
6x	su own
	bash$ su own
	_=/usr/sbin/named
	_=/usr/local/sbin/sshd
2x	_=/bin/su

This clearly shows that the attacker logged in as adm1, but su-ed to own
afterwards.  The login came from the supposed address.


[=-=-=-=-=-=-=]                   Eggdrop                    [=-=-=-=-=-=-=]

After the instalation of trojans, the attacker launched an IRC bot (eggdrop)
with a pack of TCL scripts written by T0R0 (tPACK-2.3).  All the bot files
were stored, unpacked and compiled in /dev (see misc/tpackparent and
misc/eggdropdir).  After the installation, the whole directory was removed.

He had not been very cautious this time, because he forgot to remove
drosen's (the user under which he ran the bot) .bash_history.  One of
the deleted files (restored using debugfs, saved in misc/eggdrop_timestamp)
shows that the bot has been launched at Nov  8, 08:58:56.
