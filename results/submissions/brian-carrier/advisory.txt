                                  #000001
                              February 19, 2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Information:
System: apollo.honey.edu (172.16.1.101)
OS: Redhat Linux 6.2
Patches: None

Compromise Information:
Date: Nov 7, 2000 23:11:50 CST
Method: Format string overflow in rpc.statd
Detection Date: Nov 8 19:40:20 CST

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The host was compromised using an unpatched version of rpc.statd that
contains a format string vulnerability[1].  This action was detected by
the snort Intrusion Detection System.   

After gaining access, the attacker installed a rootkit into /usr/man/.Ci.
The rootkit is a modified version of the Linux RootKit 4 (lrk4).  It
contained several trojaned binaries including /bin/ps, /bin/ls, /bin/netstat,
/sbin/ifconfig, /usr/bin/top, /usr/sbin/syslogd, and /usr/sbin/tcpd.
A trojan copy of sshd was also installed that logs user name and passwords
to /var/tmp/nap.

The attacker also upgraded several services including: am-utils, lpd,
make, screen, telnet, ypserv, wu-ftp, nfs-utils, named.

The attacker also installed several IRC binaries including bitchX and
eggdrop.  bitchX was installed as part of the .Ci rootkit and eggdrop was
installed separately in /dev/tpack.  Eggdrop was installed using a 
distribution called tPACK 2.3.  

The system had not been used when it was compromised so no data was stolen.

Our forensics analysis was able to recover almost all of the deleted files
including the rootkit and eggdrop installation .tar files.  We were also able
to recover deleted log entries and the IP addresses of where the attack
came from.
