A cost estimate for this analysis is slightly hard to calculate since I 
started the analysis as a test case for my forensic tools, TCTUtils and 
autopsy.  It was only after I had finished half of the analysis that I
decided to complete it and enter the results.  

Therefore, my time spent was not recorded in the beginning and much time
was spent debugging my applications and developing new ones.  It is 
assumed that future investigations would be done much quicker.  

I will estimate my time at 8 days (at 8 hours per day).  This includes
writing the report, which has gone through many formats.  This too would
be done much quicker the next time around.  We will assume my yearly salary
is $70,000/yr ($33.65/hr).


                 Hours   Cost      Total      +15%      -15%
Investigation    64      $33.65    $2154      $2476     $1831

Benefits (28%)                      $603       $693      $512

Total                              $2757      $3169     $2343


Since this challenge is supposed to be fun, lets recalculate this with my
graduate student salary of $13,200/yr ($6.35/hr).

                 Hours   Cost      Total      +15%      -15%
Investigation    64      $6.35     $406       $467      $345

Benefits (28%)                     $114       $131      $96

Total                              $520       $598      $441



BACKGROUND
I am a computer science graduate student at Purdue University doing research
with the Center for Education in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS).  
This was my first complete forensic analysis.

System Administration: 7 years of administering personal UNIX flavors and 
  did administration for year in undergrad.

Programming: 7 years of programming.  My main languages are C and Java.

Security: Have been involved with security for 6 years and done research in
  cryptography and forensics.   I have worked as a security consultant and
  have done development for a commercial VPN system.
