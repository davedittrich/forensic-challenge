Honeypot University
February 16, 2001

On November 7, 2000 at 23:11:50 CST an attacker gained unauthorized
access to a University computer system.  After gaining access they
installed some applications to fix the vulnerabilities that gave them
access, installed applications to allow easy "back door" access to the
system in the future, and installed some applications for use in
Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

This system had only been running since November 5, 2000 and did not 
contain any university related data.

The identity of the attacker is not known at this time, but the Honeypot
University Police Department (HUPD) is following leads that were gathered
by the Honeypot University Computer Center (HUCC).
