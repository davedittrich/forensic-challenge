!!!! A collection of files from the rootkit
!!!! Some are still in the /usr/man/.Ci
!!!! Some are found in the partial tar files
!!!! I think this package brought more rpm's but I could not find
!!!! them. I'm still missing the way how the following rpm's got
!!!! installed on the system (they are older than RH 6.2 ISO):
!!!!	am-utils-6.0.1s11-1.6.0.*.rpm
!!!!	lpr-0.48-1.*.rpm
!!!!	make-3.77-6.*.rpm
!!!!	screen-3.9.4-3.*.rpm

	Trying *.*.*.*...
	Connected to foo.

	bl4w!_
