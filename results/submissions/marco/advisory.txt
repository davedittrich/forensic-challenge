Incident
========
* We had a root compromise on apollo.honeyp.edu! The system is now
  offline and is now being examined.
* The time of exposure was between 2000-11-08 14:48:15+00 and
  2000-11-09 *:*:00+00 (The challenge did not provide a time when this
  box was taken offline!)
* There were a lot of sniffing and monitoring tools installed on the
  system. But so far we have only evidence that a network sniffer and
  a trojaned sshd were activated.
* The used tools do not look as this was a very high profile
  intruder.
!! All user/passwords in this LAN segment may be compromised!!
!! All user/passwords from users who used ssh/scp to appolo.homeyp.edu
   during that time ARE compromised!!

Next Steps (reasonable paranoid):
===========
* Do NOT change passwords yet! (There may be other compromised boxes!)
1. Check all the Linux boxes if they are compromised. (Use the
   evidence.txt as example on what to look for) Use private copies of
   the system commands (ls, find, ps, top etc)
1.1. If another compromised box is found
1.1.1. -> REPORT to <sec-office@honeyp.edu>
1.1.2. Take it offline whenever possible.
1.1.3. Wait for <sec-office@honeyp.edu> with the next steps.
1.2. If this box was lucky. (Do the following from the (text!) console
     or a trusted remote system. Do NOT consider X11 as save unless
     you're on a trusted system with tight security settings!)
1.2.1. Patch it to the current patch level & install a trusted sshd
       and tcp wrapper(if not yet used).
1.2.2. Disable all unneeded services (ftp, telnet, rlogin, rsh as
       well, replaced by sshd) and install tight tcpd permissions
       for everything else.
1.2.3. Leave the box and slogin from a trusted system. Change or lock
       all the passwords on the system.

2. Check all the other boxes for signs of a compromise. This attacker
   had Linux systems as primary targets but this does not mean that
   other systems may not be compromised.
2.*. Follow the needed steps as outlined in 1.[12].

3. Change or lock all the remaining passwords.

4. Create and/or enforce a prober security policy.

5. Name designated security observers for all used OS's.

6. Report to <sec-office@honeyp.edu>. <sec-office@honeyp.edu> will
   write a final report after that incident.
