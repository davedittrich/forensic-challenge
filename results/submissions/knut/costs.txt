I worked alone and I spent approx. 15 hours 
on the analysis and documentation. 
Based on an average of 1900 hours of work per year the
salary costs add up to 15/1900*70,000 = $553

My experience in programming: 15 years (incl. university)
My experience in system administration: 11 years (mostly part time)
My experience in security: 4 years full time as a security consultant,
                           before that, 6 years part time as a system/
                           network administrator.


To reinstall a RH6.2 default server 1-2 hours
might be needed depending on the complexity of the
hardware and the configuration, so total labor costs
should be around $600.
