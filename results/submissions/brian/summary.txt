RE: Recent computer break-in


On November 7, 2000, The HoneyP.edu intrusion detection alarms triggered,
alerting the incident response team to a possible break-in.  Upon further
investigation, it was discovered a breach did occur against one of the
university computer systems.

Appropriate actions by the incident response team were undertaken to
quickly remove the subject computer from the network, collect system
evidence for forensic review and possible prosecution of the 
perpetrator(s).

Analysis of the evidence revealed a known vulnerability was exploited.
An advisory to all HoneyP.edu System Administrators and Managers was
issued with details on patching the exposure. At this time, it is believed
only this one system was compromised.  The advisory stressed the importance 
of reviewing similarly configured systems for intrusion. 

Due to the nature of the break-in, it is recommended that each HoneyP.edu
system be audited. Once the system reviews are completed, all system and
user passwords must be changed.

The compromised system was quickly recovered, the vulnerability patched,
and returned to service with little disruption to the user community.
