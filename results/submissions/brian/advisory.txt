               **** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ****



On November 7, 2000, The HoneyP.edu intrusion detection alarms triggered,
alerting the incident response team to a possible break-in.  Upon further
investigation, it was discovered a breach did occur against one of the
university computer systems.

Appropriate actions by the incident response team were undertaken to
quickly remove the subject computer from the network, collect system
evidence for forensic review and possible prosecution of the 
perpetrator(s).
