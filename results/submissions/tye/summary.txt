On November 8 at 8:10 pm we discovered that one of our Linux 6.2 computers
had been successfully attacked. The computer was removed from service at
that time. Our logs indicate that the attack occurred Nov 7 11:11pm CST. The
attack originated from a home.com cable modem account. Although attackers
had gained full access to this computer, no sensitive data was compromised.
The attackers only used this computer to set up a communications link using
IRC. We have upgraded the computer to remove the vulnerability used by the
attacker. The files the attacker added or changed were removed and the
computer returned to service.
