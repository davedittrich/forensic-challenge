INTRUSION METHOD

Evidence of initial entry point shows a buffer overflow was exploited in rstatd 
This confirms Snort's NOOP alarm (of Nov 7 23:11:51) - (see attach01.txt)


ATTACKER IDENTITY
"c871553-b.jffsn1.mo.home.com" appears in /var/log/lastlog 
/var/log/secure has entries for the user from home.com (216.216.x.x)

/var/tmp/nap has this suspicious data (most likely the password for the trojaned inetd)

From undeleted on root partition:
"adduser $z *!*toro@will.fuck.for.an.o-line.st"
This is most likely an IRC identity


ADDED/MODIFIED/CREATED FILES
See attach02.txt

SNIFFER 
LinSniffer was installed
An IRC server whose source code was in "tpack2.3.tar.gz" was compiled and installed as well

ROOTKIT/CONCEALMENT
Upon initial entry, rootkit was installed, 
/usr/man/.Ci has various scripts and binaries that the hacker installed 

The list of networks the hacker most likely has other accounts is in /usr/man/.a

/usr/man/.p,p,r is the list of commands that the hacker was able to hide from legitimate sysadmins
(implying the kinds of activity that was performed)

Other suspicious evidence that was deleleted and recovered from the root partition is included
See attach03.txt
