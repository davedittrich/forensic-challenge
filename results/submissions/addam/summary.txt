Management and media (non-technical) summary
============================================

At 11:11 pm CST on November 7, 2000 monitoring programs on the Honeypot University network 
recorded activity from an outside machine attempting to break into a campus computer.  The 
logs revealed that an intruder did manage to compromise the host through a service that 
had been running because of the default configuration.  The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) 
status monitor is used in association with NFS, a networked file system.  By sending a 
specially formatted string containing machine instructions to the status monitor, the 
intruder was able to gain control of the system.

After infiltrating the host, the intruder replaced commonly used programs and removed log file
information to hide his/her activity.  An analysis of the system showed that this intruder 
installed a modified version of a secure login program that collected usernames and passwords
to a file, presumably for the intruder to use later.  Additionally, a program to record
information travelling over the network was also installed and running.  Captured data could
contain other user passwords being transmitted across the network.

The intruder remained on the compromised machine for less than one hour.  After noticing the
attack, system administrators made copies of the disk for analysis and shutdown the machine.

A campus-wide advisory has been sent to all system and network administrators to check for
other vulnerable machines and make appropriate upgrades to eliminate the problem.
