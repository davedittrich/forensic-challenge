                      The Apollo Incident: Costs.

1.  Cost calculation

   The time spent investigating the system and writing the report
   totalled 37 hours.  The hourly wage rate is assumed to be $33.65,
   corresponding to an annual salary of $70,000.  We arrive at the
   following calculation:

      Wage             $   1,245.05
      Benefits (28%)   $     348.61
      ------------------------------
      Total            $   1,593.66


   This calculation does not contain the time necessary to re-install
   and fully patch apollo.  However, the cost for this can be estimated
   to be certainly below $100, and is thus within the 15% adjustment
   margin.

2.  Background information

   I have been collecting programming experience since the late 1980s.
   In 1997, I was involved with the development of PGPlib (the project
   died when PGP5 was published). Since 1997, I've been involved with
   the development of the mutt mail user agent. Since June 1998, I'm the
   lead developer of the project.

   My first encounter with Unix was in early 1993.  Since early 1995, I
   have been administering various Linux and IRIX systems, most of them
   at the University of Bonn, Germany.

   My interest in computer security dates from approximately 1995/96. I
   had several opportunities to investigate actual break-ins, and to
   observe break-in attempts.  However, there were always constraints in
   place which made a thorough investigation impossible.
