<h1>teo</h1>
<ul>
<li> Mactime uses local passwd/group file instead of corpse.</p>
<li> All mactimes are in the wrong time units (local to analyst?)
so that logfiles and mactimes do not correlate.</p>
<li> No deleted mactime analysis.</p>
<li> No file checksum analysis (rpm verify).</p>
<li> No file disassembly.</p>
<li> Lastlog analysis misses users not in the passwd file.</p>
<li> Did unrm analysis.</p>
<li> Recovered deleted messages file.</p>
<li> Recovered root bash history messages file.</p>
<li> Did swap analysis.</p>
<li> Recovered environment from swap.</p>
<li> Recovered logging from swap.</p>
<li> Misdiagnosed "inetd[408]: pid 2387: exit status 1"
	as inetd restart.</p>
<li> Miscalculated clock skew between IDS and victim as 18
minutes.</p>
<li> Found sniffer and sshd password logger, and the ssh universal
password. </p>
<li> Gets around rootkit by mounting evidence on loopback.  File
filesystem_changes.txt purpose of files and their config files>
	They recovered the script that installs all the rootkit
	replacement binaries and that links bash history files
	to /dev/null.</p>
<li> Claims the deleted bash_history file is from immediately
after the statd exploit, however the commands in bash_history
that run "uptime" and truncate /etc/hosts.deny correspond
with mactime patterns 8 hours after exploit.
	The reason for this mistake is that all mactimes are in
	the wrong time units (relative to analyst?).</p>
<li> Evidence presentation is good, well organized, but fatal errors
made in the analysis.  Their mactimes are offset by many hours, thus
no correlation of events with logfiles. They do a lastlog analysis but
miss the users not in the passwd file.  There's no checksum analysis,
little strings analysis of programs, no decompilation.  </p>

<li> Summary gives no indication whether user files or other systems
were affected. </p>

<li> Focus of advisory is on statd vulnerability, but also mention
of what intruder does.  detection is OK: linked .bash_history->/dev/null,
sshd in rc.local, minor inaccuracy that /usr/tmp/nap contains
magic password, misses the deleted shutdown account.</p>

<li> Used available tools, good analysis of swap space.</p>

<li> Excellent advisory, detailed but simple to read.</p>
<li> Very good warning about TELNET/FTP to systems.</p>
<li> evidence.txt file extremely well written.</p>

</ul>
