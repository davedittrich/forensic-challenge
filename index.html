<p> <a name="intro" class="heading"> Introduction </a>
</p>
<p> Every day, incident handlers across the globe are faced with compromised
systems, running some set of unknown programs, providing some kind of unintended
service to an intruder who has taken control of someone else's -- YOUR, or your
client's, or customer's -- computers. To most, the response is a matter of "get
it back online
ASAP and be done with it." This usually leads to an inadequate and ineffective
response, not even knowing what hit you, with a high probability of repeated
compromise.
<P> On the law enforcement side, they are hampered by a flood of incidents and
a lack of good data. A victim trying to keep a system running or
doing a "quickie" job of cleanup usually means incidents are underreported and
inadequate handling of the evidence leads to no evidence, or tainted evidence.
There has to be a better way to meet the needs of incident handlers and system
administrators, as well as law enforcement, if Internet crime is going to be
managed and not run amok. One possible answer is effective forensic analysis
skills -- widespread knowledge of tools and techniques -- to preserve data, analyze
it, and produce meaningful reports and damage estimates to your organization's
management, to other incident response teams and system administrators, and to
law enforcement.
<P> Enter the Honeynet Project. One of the primary goals of the Honeynet Project
is to find order in chaos by letting the attackers do their thing, and allowing
the defenders to learn from the experience and improve. The latest challenge,
inspired by the Honeynet Project's founder Lance Spitzner, is the Forensic Challenge.
Only this time, we're opening it up to
anyone who wants to join in.
<P><a name="challenge" class="heading"> The Challenge </a>
<P> The Forensic Challenge is an effort to allow incident handlers around the
world to all look at the same data -- an image reproduction of the same compromised
system -- and to see who can dig the most out of that system and communicate
what they've found in a concise manner. This is a nonscientific study of tools,
techniques, and procedures applied to postcompromise incident handling. The challenge
is to have fun, to solve a common real world problem, and for everyone to learn
from the process. If what I've said already isn't enough to get you interested,
Foundstone is generously offering copies of their extremely
popular "Hacking Exposed" (Second Edition) book for the 20 best submissions.

 <p>Please be aware that these are new images. This is <b>not</b> a system that the
Honeynet Project has previously written about or discussed publically. (I.e.,
you won't get any hints from previous Honeynet papers.) The images were edited
to anonymize the system. Only the hostname was modified. Everyone is using the
same data, so any
anomalies caused by this editing will be identical.</p>
<P class="bold"> The image files can be mounted on Linux systems using the loopback interface
like this:
<pre> # mkdir /t
 # mount -o ro,loop,nodev,noexec honeypot.hda8.dd /t
 # mount -o ro,loop,nodev,noexec honeypot.hda1.dd /t/boot
 [ etc... ]

<p> Its now your job -- should you choose to accept it! -- to figure out the
Who, What, Where, When, How, and maybe even the Why of this compromise. We don't
expect that everyone undertaking the challenge can or will address all of the
following items, but the list below of questions and deliverables is provided
as a guideline for what
to produce and what to focus on:
<OL class="pstyle">
  <LI> Identify the intrusion method, its date, and time. (Assume the clock on
  the IDS was synchronized with an NTP reference time source.)</LI>
  <LI> Identify as much as possible about the intruder(s).</LI>
  <LI> List all the files that were added/modified by the intruder. Provide an
  analysis of these programs (including decompilation or disassembly where necessary
  to determine their function and role in the incident.)</LI>
  <LI> Was there a sniffer or password harvesting program installed? If so, where
  and what files are associated with it?</LI>
  <LI> Was there a "rootkit" or other post-concealment trojan horse programs
  installed on the system? If so, what operating system programs were replaced
  and how could you get around them? Hint: If you don't know what a "rootkit" is,
  read this:
  <P> <a href="https://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/faqs/rootkits.faq"> http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/faqs/rootkits.faq</a> </LI>
  <LI>
  <P>What
  is publicly known about the source of any programs found on the system? (e.g.,
  their authors, where source code can be found, what exploits or advisories
  exist about them, etc.)  
  </LI>
  <LI> Build a time line of events and provide a detailed analysis of activity
  on the system, noting sources of supporting or confirming evidence (elsewhere
  on the system or compared with a known "clean" system of similar configuration.)</LI>
  <LI> Provide a report suitable for management or news media (general aspects
  of the intrusion without specific identifying data).</LI>
  <LI> Provide an advisory for use within the home organization (a fictitious
  university, "honeyp.edu", in this case, where I hold an honorary Doctorate,
  by the way) to explain the key aspects of the vulnerability exploited, how
  to detect and defend against this vulnerability, and how to determine if other
  systems were similarly compromised.</LI>
  <LI> Produce a cost-estimate for this incident using the following guidelines
  and method:
  <P> <a href="https://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/faqs/incidentcosts.faq"> http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/faqs/incidentcosts.faq</a>
  <P> To simplify and to normalize the results, assume that your annual salary
    is $70,000 and that there are no user-related costs. (If you work as a team,
    break out hours by person, but all members should use the same annual salary.
    Please also include a brief description of each investigator's number of
    years of experience in the fields of system administration, programming,
    and security, just to help us compare the number of hours spent with other
    entrants).
  </LI>
</OL>

    this is a Honeynet Project brainchild, so learning is what it's all about.

            books go to other entrants.
  <li> Entries must be written in English (UK and Aussie English
              accepted, but go light on the regional slang, please! I only have
              a copy of "<i>Best of Aussie Slang</i>," and the other judges don't
              live in Seattle.)
  <li> Only one entry per household, please. Must be sentient to
                enter. Sorry, no Ginsu Knives come with this offer! </ul>
<p>Submissions will be judged by a panel of experts and winners selected and announced
on Monday, March 19, 2001. All decisions of the judges are final (no recounts
or legal challenges by teams of grossly
overpaid lawyers will be tolerated!).</p>
<P> After the winners are announced, all entries will be posted for the security
community to review. We hope that the community can better learn from and improve
from all the
different techniques that different people and organizations use.
<p> Also, we wouldn't be the Honeynet Project if we didn't capture all of the
blackhat's keystrokes as he exploited, accessed, and modified the honeypot! We
will release the Honeypot Project's analysis of the hacked system, as well as
the blackhat's keystrokes, along
with the results of the Challenge on March 19.
<P> Good luck, and have fun!
<P> Dave Dittrich</ul></td>
